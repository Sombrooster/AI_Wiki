            <h4 id="Evolutionary">Evolutionary Algorithms</h4>
                <p class="h4">A set of many generated programs are given a set of inputs
                    and the expectation of a certain output. The first “generation” will
                    do poorly initially, but, by random chance, some will outperform their
                    counterparts. The programs who performed best then are used to
                    psuedo-randomly create the next “generation” using their interworking
                    variables as a seed.This cycle is repeated until eventually, a program
                    is created that can perform the task at hand with great accuracy.</p>

                <h5>Genetic Algorithms</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Genetic algorithms are a subsect of evolutionary algorithms. They organize
                        the interworkings into specific “chromosomes” Allows for a more efficient creation
                        process of the next generation by noticing which specific parts work. This difference
                        is also the crux of our next form of machine learning</p>

            <h4 id="ANN">Artificial Neural Networks </h4>
                <p class="h4">Instead of having a generation of many bots, neural networks use one bot that
                    is tinkered over time to acheive the desired output. Based in linear algebra and vectors.[INSERT PICTURE]</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>13th Century:</b> Ramon Lull a Spanish theologian, invented machines for discovering
                        non-mathematical truths through combinatorics.</li>
                    <li><b>1642:</b> Pascal created the first mechanical digital calculating machine.</li>
                    <li><b>1801:</b> Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented the Jacquard loom, the first programmable
                        machine, instructions for the machine were on punched cards.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4 id="Turing_Test">Turing Test (1950)</h4>
                <p class="h4">Developed by <b>Alan Turing(1912 - 1954)</b> in 1950, in which a human evaluator
                    would judge the test. Knowing that he is communicating with a human on one side and
                    a machine on the other side. All three parties are separated and limited to text.
                    The evaluator is only supposed to look at how close answers are to an answer that a
                    human would give, the correctness of the answer does not matter.If the evaluator
                    cannot tell the machine from the human, then the machine has passed the test.</p>

            <h4 id="To_Today">To Today (1956 - Today)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1956:</b> John McCarthy cointed term 'Artificial Intelligence' as the topic

        <h3 id="Future">Potential Future of AI </h3>
            <h4 id="Widespread_Adoption">Widespread Adoption</h4>
                <p class="h4">The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence is one that we will eventually see
                    in our lifetime, and are already somewhat seeing in today's day and age. One example would
                    be the fact that everyones phone most likely has some sort of helping A.I., and we can
                    expect in the future that It will be more complex based on the expectations of A.I.</p>
            <h4 id="Integration">Integration </h4>
                <p class="h4">The integration in regards to our technology and A.I., is one that will not be as difficult
                    as most people would think. </p>
            <h4 id="Potential_Positives">Positives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-driving vehicles that are more safe and aware than humans</li>
                    <li>The integration into geological studies in order to predict natural disasters and more.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4 id="Potential_Negatives">Negatives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>An artificial intelligence that can think and act in superior ways than a human can.
                        (This is probably not in our lifetime, as the process of making a artificial intelligence
                        based solely on the neurological pathways in our brains is very complex.</li>
                    <li>The room for human creativity in the technological might be squandered if the
                        artificial intelligence that’s integrated is designed to think for itself
                        and not for the person using it.</li>
