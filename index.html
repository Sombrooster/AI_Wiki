        <h3 id="Summary">Summary</h3>
            <p>The computational attempt of imitating human intelligence in order to solve a problem given specific
                variables using logic. Artificial Intelligence ranges from simplistic rational agents, following given
                steps to reach the desired end, to advanced multilayered general-purpose neural networks, which attempt
                to imitate, match, or succeed the capabilities of human intelligence. There are different types,
                methods, and applications of artificial intelligence.</p>

        <h3 id="Types">Types</h3>
            <h4 id="Strong_AI">Strong Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                <p class="h4">Matches or succeeds human intelligence, is capable of performing any given
                    task <a href="#13">[13]</a>. This kind of AI does not exist as of 2018.</p>

            <h4 id="Weak_AI">Weak Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                <p class="h4">Designed to solely perform specific subset of intelligent actions<a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>


            <h4 id="Intelligent_Agents">Intelligent Agents</h4>
                <p class="h4">An agent is any entity that perceives its environment through sensors and reacts upon
                environment through effectors. A rational agent will do the right thing given what it believes from
                what it perceives. In order to achieve maximum success, the agent should be able to decide what is
                the right thing, and how and when to evaluate success <a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>

                <h5>Simple Reflex Agent</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Detects and interprets its environment, uses a set of rules to decide next action,
                    and then acts out on the calculated response <a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>
                <h5>Model Based Reflex</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Detects and interprets its environment, keeps record of how world continues to change
                    and the cause and effect relationship between its actions and this change, uses set of rules and
                    the experience it has gathered to act out on a calculated response <a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>
                <h5>Goal-Based Agents</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Detects and interprets its environment, keeps record of how world continues to change
                    and the cause and effect relationship between its actions and this change, theorizes how its actions
                    will change the environment before acting out on them, uses set of goals to achieve to calculate
                    its next action <a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>
                <h5>Utility-Based Agents</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Detects and interprets its environment, keeps record of how world continues to change
                    and the cause and effect relationship between its actions and this change, theorizes how its actions
                    will change the environment, uses weights to measure how this change will fulfill its utility, acts
                    on action if it beneficial towards the given goal <a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>
                <h5>Learning Agents</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Detects and interprets its environment, evaluates effectiveness of all previous
                    actions compared to the most recent action as according to a set performance standard, utilizes a
                    learning element to modify its approach and theorizes potential future issues, then acts
                    accordingly to what was learned <a href="#13">[13]</a>.</p>


        <h3 id="Methods">Methods of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <h4 id="Traditional">Traditional Algorithms</h4>
                <p class="h4">A fail-safe procedure, guaranteed to achieve a specific goal <a href="#2">[2]</a> or the
                              formal computation of a step-by-step sequence which achieves a desired output.
                              The first notion of an algorithm begins with al-Khowarazmi, the Arabian
                              mathematician who introduced numerals and algebra to Western Society. Algorithms were
                              not given a formal mathematical syntax until George Boole's Boolean Algebra, which was
                              later expanded upon by Gottlob Frege and Alfred Tarski <a href="#4">[4]</a>.</p>

                <h5>Logical Positivism</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Connects observational sentences to sensory input. Confirmation theory attempts to
                        further actualize how knowledge can be acquired from experience.
                        Rooted in the empiricist movement in the 17th century, logical positivism was shaped
                        by Bertrand Russell around the turn of the 20th century, which was expanded upon by Confirmation
                        Theory of Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel <a href="#4">[4]</a>.</p>

                <h5>Heuristics </h5>
                    <p class="h5">An algorithm which can not guarantee a correct answer which works as a procedure to
                        infer the most likely correct answer. Heuristics can be used to estimate noncomputable programs
                        and are usually correct, but not always correct <a href="#2">[2]</a>. Heuristics are commonly
                        analogized by the means-ends analysis of a problem, which involves the computation of the
                        difficulty of functions served, which functions are required, and the means by which to
                        approach the problem <a href="#4">[4]</a>.</p>

            <h4 id="Evolutionary">Evolutionary Algorithms</h4>
                <p class="h4">A large set of generated programs are given a set of inputs
                    and the expectation of a certain output. The first “generation” usually
                    does poorly, but, by random chance, some will outperform their
                    counterparts. The programs who performed best then are used to
                    psuedo-randomly create the next “generation” using the variables of their interworkings
                    as a seed. This cycle is repeated until a program that can perform the task at hand with
                    great accuracy is created <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>

                <h5>Genetic Algorithms</h5>
                    <p class="h5">Genetic algorithms are a subsection of evolutionary algorithms. They detect the
                        fitness of successful programs within the generation and analyze specific
                        successful patterns found within the interworkings of the programs and organize them into
                        'chromosomes' or 'gene'. Allows for a more efficient creation process of the next generation
                        by identifying which aspects of the logic used to achieve the correct answer are most
                        effective <a href="#4">[4]</a><a href="#14">[14]</a>.</p>

            <img src="http://www.texample.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/neural-network.png" alt="Artificial Neural Network Diagram">
            <h4 id="ANN">Artificial Neural Networks </h4>
                <p class="h4">An imitation of biological neural networks in the brain, Artificial Neural Networks use
                    examples given to automatically infer rules of a given desired input and output. Adding
                    examples increases the accuracy of the Neural Network <a href="#3">[3]</a>. Each artificial
                    neuron has one output and a many inputs. Each input will have a weight associated
                    with it which determines how much the input affects a neuron's single output. This output is
                    determined by adding the weights of all inputs that receive a 1, and if a certain threshold is
                    reached, the output is 1 <a href="#2">[2]</a>.</p>

                <h5>Deep Learning </h5>
                    <p class="h5"> Deep Convolutional Neural Networks are a commonly used and effective approach in the
                        utilization of neural network. They are distinguished by their use of <b>local receptive fields,
                            shared weights, </b> and <b> pooling </b> <a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p>

                    <h6>Local Receptive Fields</h6>
                        <p class="h6">Determines which parts of the data prove to be most consistently useful, breaking
                            down the data into its most important variables <a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p>

                    <h6>Shared Weights</h6>
                        <p class="h6">Uses hidden layers to analyze specific sections of the data for specific patterns
                            and shares the weights of the useful detected patterns with the other layers. This applies
                            a feature detector throughout the data <a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p>

                    <h6>Pooling</h6>
                        <p class="h6">Generalizes the data by by asking whether a given feature within the data is
                            found. The exact positional information is discarded, and is replaced with its rough
                            location relative to other features. This gives the network an intuition overlooking any
                            specifics dynamic variables or anomalies within the data <a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p>

            <h4 id="Optimization">Optimization</h4>
                <p class="h4">Commonly utilizes the <a href="#Evolutionary">Genetic Algorithm</a> to create a program
                which can optimize functionality and sort data at a rate much faster than any human being could
                program themselves. These can exist as the entire agent function with a sole purpose to optimize
                or as a component function, in which case it acts as the critic of its actions<a href="#4">[4]</a>.</p>

            <h4 id="Marketing">Marketing</h4>
                <p class="h4">The internet has recently utilized artificial intelligence to maximize the amount of
                time a user spends on a given website or the amount of money a user is willing to spend and what
                specific products a user would want to buy. This is determined through a combination of a user's
                internet history and its measurement by the success rate of the desired action of the user
                <a href="#1">[1]</a>. This kind of artificial intelligence can be seen all throughout the internet
                and can force a user into their own "bubble" of the internet, where they can only be exposed to
                certain information at the discretion of an 'all knowing algorithm'.</p>

                    would judge the test. Knowing that he is communicating with a human on one side and
                    a machine on the other side. All three parties are separated and limited to text.
                    The evaluator is only supposed to look at how close answers are to an answer that a
                    human would give, the correctness of the answer does not matter.If the evaluator
                    cannot tell the machine from the human, then the machine has passed the test.</p>
